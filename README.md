# Minimal Teleportation

Teleport to your teammates!

## Usage

The command `/tp` is modified that it allows teleportations by non-operators with conditions.

- Non-operators can now teleport themselves to players in the same team with command `/tp <player>`.

- Non-operators can now request players in other teams to teleport to them with command `/tp <player>`.
  
  - The destination player can accept or refuse the request with command `/tpa` or `/tpr`.

The command `/tp` will be the same as vanilla when executed by operators with permission level 2 or higher.

## Installation

Requires the latest Fabric Loader and Fabric API.

For multiplayer games, the mod only needs to be installed on the server side
